<h1 align="center">Snake Game</h1>
<p>Imagine that you are a hungry snake who is trapped inside the room. Whatever comes in your way, you eat it. It is obvious that you cannot eat the wall of the room and yourself. An new apple appears in the room after eating the old apple. This leads you to an instant growth of height. Try to reach the score of 50+. My best score so far is 32.</p>
