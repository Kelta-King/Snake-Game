<p>Imagine that you are a hungry snake who is trapped inside the room. Whatever comes in your way, you eat it. It is obvious that you cannot eat the wall of the room and yourself. A new apple appears in the room after eating the old one. This leads you to an instant growth of height. Try to reach the score of 50+. My best score so far is 32.</p>
<p>Just click on the gaming area and <b>BOOM! Game begins...</b></p>
